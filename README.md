### Corpus

> **_IMPORTANT_** â€” There is a corpus size limit of 5MB at the moment and document size limit of 0.5MB

All the documents to be used by the model should go into the corpus folder.
There is a strict naming convention that is a 3 digit prefix and a description with the `.txt` extension appended.

```
000-short-description
```

The very first line of the file is reserved for the associated link/label. Which will be used to label the document. The first line should only be packed with the link follow by a link break and nothing else.

```
